In the quiet hours,
I see you pull up,
And now it's clear,
That I just want...

That I just want... to disappear.

In the quiet hours,
As the light goes dim,
I see you pull up,
But I don't know why, and I don't know why.
You're sitting down.
Your eyes are flared.
The fire from the setting sun never sets on us though.

At dusk everything looks beautiful to me.
Fire dancin' with the shadows coming through the trees.
A light appears and settles into place.
Turns the world into a different place.

Our memory is playing like a reel of film on the back of our eyelids.
I wish we could go back home to a time when we were just kids.

Cruisin' down the coast, I looked for something that I never had.
Now I see that it's something that I lost instead.

At dusk everything looks beautiful to me.
Fire dancin' with the shadows coming through the trees.
A light appears and settles into place.
Turns the world into a different place.

In the quiet hours,
I see you pull up,
And now it's clear,
That I just want... to disappear.

(To disappear...)

(To disappear...)
At dusk everything looks beautiful to me.
(To disappear...)
Fire dancin' with the shadows coming through the trees.
(To disappear...)
A light appears and settles into place.
(To disappear...)
Turns the world into a different place...
